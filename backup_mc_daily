# This script is intended to be run by cron for periodic backups of Minecraft data.
# The script scans the logs for player names, the number of times they've joined and the most recent date they've joined.
# The number of times they have joined is used to limint the number of player names to search which speeds up the search.
# The log search is used as criteria to determine if a backup is required. If a player with more than minimum_plays has 
#   joined since the last backup then a backup is required.
# Sample cron entry 0 10 * * * /home/mcserver/minecraft/mc_backup/backup_mc_daily runs the script at 10:00 AM every day.
